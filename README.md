## Description
This project focuses on analyzing employee performance and attrition trends within a company. Using a data visualization dashboard, key metrics related to attrition rates, employee demographics, job roles, and satisfaction levels were explored to identify patterns and insights. The dashboard serves as a decision-support tool for HR and management teams to improve employee retention strategies and overall satisfaction.

## Goals
- Evaluate overall attrition rates and identify trends by department, age group, gender, and job role.
- Analyze employee satisfaction across job roles.
- Provide actionable recommendations to improve retention rates and employee satisfaction.

## Insight Dependency
The analysis relies on:
- Key Metrics: Employee count, active employees, attrition count, attrition rate, and average age.
- Departmental Analysis: Attrition distribution across HR, R&D, and Sales.
- Demographics: Breakdown of employees and attrition rates by age group and gender.
- Job Role Insights: Attrition by job role and corresponding job satisfaction levels.

Insights
1. Attrition Trends:
The overall attrition rate is 16.12%, with the highest attrition observed in the R&D department (56.12%) and lowest in HR (5.06%).
Attrition is more common among employees aged 30–40 years (42.31%).

2. Gender Distribution:
Male employees account for the majority of attrition cases (150 compared to 87 females).

3.Job Role Analysis:
The Laboratory Technician and Sales Executive roles experience the highest attrition, while managerial roles have the lowest rates.

4. Satisfaction Levels:
Job satisfaction varies across roles, with some (e.g., Healthcare Representatives) showing higher levels of satisfaction compared to others (e.g., Sales Executives).

## Advice

Retention Strategies:
- Focus on targeted retention programs for high-attrition departments like R&D and roles like Laboratory Technician.
- Address factors driving attrition in the 30–40 age group, potentially by introducing career development opportunities and flexible work arrangements.

Gender-Specific Initiatives:
Analyze factors contributing to male attrition and implement gender-specific initiatives to ensure balance and equity.

Improving Job Satisfaction:
- Conduct surveys and focus groups for roles with lower satisfaction (e.g., Sales Executives) to identify areas for improvement.
- Leverage best practices from roles with higher satisfaction levels to apply across the organization.
